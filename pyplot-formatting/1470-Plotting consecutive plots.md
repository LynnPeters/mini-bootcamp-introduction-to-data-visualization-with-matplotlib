# Plotting Consecutive Plots

### Learning Objectives

* Why Pyplot formatting?
* Plotting consecutive graphs
* Combining two plots into one



### Pyplot Formatting

Are you tired of those plain, boring graphs? Want them to convey more information at once? Then this module is perfect for you!

We'll be working on the same dataset, i.e., on the [Standard Metropolitan Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/Standard_Metropolitan_Areas_Data-data.csv).

### Plotting consecutive plots using Matplotlib

Plotting data on multiple consecutive figures can be done by calling the corresponding graphing functions and displaying each figure consecutively:

### Combining two plots into one

What happens if you don't use plt.show() after the first figure? Both variables will be plotted in the same figure:
